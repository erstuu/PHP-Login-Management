# PHP-Login-Management using MVC Design pattern
This Repository created when I learning about PHP Programming Language specially making mini project about login management using MVC Design pattern  
also I've gained this skills in Udemy "PHP Dasar sampai Mahir" from Programmer Zaman Now

# How it's done?  
This app is simply build a from username and password, where users can login using data that have been signed up. If users doesn't signed up yet, users can create an account, and once the account is registered, users can try to login/ sign in using account  
that they've registered before. After sign in, users can also edit their data, which username, or password they have, stored it as a new information of their account, and use it for sign in again!
